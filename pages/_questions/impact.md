question: What is the impact of your attacks?
---

An adversary exploiting our attack can escalate privileges from partial network access to being able to log into any device that uses RADIUS for authentication, or to assign itself arbitrary network privileges.

RADIUS is used for remote access for diverse use cases including network routers and switches, industrial control systems, VPNs, ISPs using DSL or FTTH, Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules, 2G and 3G cellular roaming and 5G DNN authentication, and mobile Wi-Fi offload with SIM card-based authentication.
